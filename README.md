# — About the Projects... 🖥️

The projects in this folder were created during my learning of courses with HTML and CSS, in tests alone with the use of tracking machines.
<br><br>
Separate the initial projects in this folder, as they are already being designed and it is easier to characterize. Some of these are simpler, others already have more observations and require a greater knowledge of CSS, mainly.
<br><br>
Below are some screenshots of the contents in the folder:
